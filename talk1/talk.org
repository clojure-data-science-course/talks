"The development of language is part of the development of the personality, 

for words are the natural means of expressing thoughts

and establishing understanding between people."

-- Maria Montessori

** 

"The only language men ever speak perfectly

is the one they learn in babyhood,

when no one can teach them anything!" 

-- Maria Montessori

"When a thorn enters the sole of your foot, you have to get another thorn.

You then remove the first thorn with the help of the second.

Afterwards you throwaway both.

[[./220px-Indischer_Maler_von_1780_001.jpg]]

** 
Likewise,

after removing the thorn of ignorance with the help of the thorn of knowledge,

you should throwaway the thorns of both knowledge and ignorance."

-- The Gospel of Sri Ramakrihna, translated by Swami Nikhilananda, 1942

“The only outwardly recognizable sign of the onset of the sensitive period for language is the child’s smile”

-- Maria Montessori, "The Absorbent Mind"

"I mentioned 'lightweight data modeling'. 

At that point, I often say something like, 'Do you know JSON?'.

After getting acknowledgment, I continue with,

** 
'Well, imagine if you could represent all your data as JSON, 

rather than a complex hierarchy of objects and methods,

and the language was designed around

making that kind of data super-easy to work with.'


** 
... It gives a hint of what it feels like to work in Clojure and think in Clojure."

-- Mark Engleberg, "Clojure vs Scala", Tuesday, December 24, 2013
